WordPress New Post Format UI Unmigrator
==========================

If you were running WordPress trunk during the development of version 3.6, you may have used the new post format UI and it's extra media fields. Since those fields were yanked from core, this plugin migrates the data back into your post content so that it isn't lost in your post meta.

This version is only slightly different from the original, changing the 'Quote' format for people who may write commentary after the blockquotes, as I do.
